# Portfolio-OS

## NOTE

The frontend as well as the backend of PortfolioOS was obviously over exagerated and on a real world application I would simplify everything in order to have a fast system.
This project, with this many modules, was only done to simulate (almost) a real world operating system and for fun, of course.
 
 Read the [WIKI](https://github.com/joao-neves95/portfolio-os/wiki) for the API.
