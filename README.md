# Portfolio-OS
 
Portfolio-OS is an online operating system where users can have their profile.<br/>

 See the [Frontend Class API Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joao-neves95/portfolio-os/master/Portfolio-OS_Frontend-Class-API.png?token=AcUY27hJ_9eIZNuxUPX-wLFMUWx4TRxNks5b-xaewA%3D%3D) to get a better understanding of how the Portfolio-OS's frontend work.

## NOTE

The frontend of PortfolioOS was obviously over exagerated and on a real world application I would simplify everything in order to have a fast system.
This project, with this many modules, was only done to simulate (almost) a real world operating system and for fun, of course.
