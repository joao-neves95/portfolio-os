# Portfolio-OS

## NOTE

The frontend as well as the backend of PortfolioOS was obviously over exagerated and on a real world application I would simplify everything in order to have a fast system.
This project, with this many modules, was only done to simulate (almost) a real world operating system and for fun, of course.
 
 See the [Frontend Class API Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joao-neves95/portfolio-os/master/Portfolio-OS_Frontend-API.png?token=AcUY2ypZh1HS2Zf1we8ozoH8EID1ovwNks5b-xVGwA%3D%3D) to get a better understanding of how the Portfolio-OS's frontend work.
